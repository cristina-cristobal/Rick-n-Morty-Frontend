Aliens are fun!
Traveling to different dimensions is wacky!
Existential dread is hilarious!

If you agree, then this is the app for you.

Welcome to the Rick and Morty Character Database. We help users learn more about the intergalactic characters on the animated program that airs on Adult Swim.

View a character's photo and name, as well as information like whether they are dead or alive, their species, gender, origin planet, and current location. After figuring out which ones you like best, add to and remove from your collection.

This app was built in React with a Rails API backend. It uses Semantic UI and custom CSS for styling.
